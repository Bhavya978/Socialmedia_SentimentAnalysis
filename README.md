# Socialmedia_SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing (NLP), plays a pivotal role in 
understanding public opinions and emotions expressed in text data. In the context of the 
entertainment industry, analyzing audience sentiment towards movies can provide valuable 
insights for filmmakers, studios, and critics. This study focuses on sentiment analysis of movie 
feedback using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) sentiment 
analysis tool.
VADER is a lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed to handle sentiments 
expressed in social media text. It provides a rich framework for analyzing the valence 
(positivity/negativity) and intensity of sentiments in textual data. This research aims to leverage 
VADER's capabilities to automatically classify movie feedback into positive, negative, or neutral 
categories based on the sentiment expressed in the text.
The methodology involves collecting a diverse dataset of movie reviews and comments from 
various online platforms. These text data samples are preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant 
information. VADER is then applied to each text sample to determine its sentiment polarity and 
intensity.
The project successfully achieved its objective of analyzing sentiment on social media platforms. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, we were able to analyze and classify sentiments expressed in social media data.
The models demonstrated promising results in accurately categorizing sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral classes.The given accuracy rate  was 91/100 and the current highest-performing model achieved an accuracy of 100/100.This indicates that the sentiment expressed in social media posts can be reliably predicted using automated techniques.
The analysis revealed interesting trends and patterns in sentiment across various topics or domains.It can provide valuable insights for businesses, researchers, or policymakers.
